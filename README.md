# ConnectFourBot
Created a working Connect 4 Bot that will run at a max depth of 7.
Implements a scoring mechanism by filling the board with "pseduo-pieces"
which tell the bot how useful each piece is (e.g how many different ways 
it can win the game / make a four). Implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning
algorithm for further optimization.
